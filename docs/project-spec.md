# Daily Activity Time Tracker - iOS App Specification (Expo/React Native)

## Project Overview
An iOS mobile application built with Expo/React Native that allows users to track the duration of their daily activities and visualize the time distribution through an interactive pie chart. Developed with Expo Go for instant preview and hot reload capabilities on iOS devices.

## Core Features

### 1. Activity Tracking
- **Activity Buttons**: Customizable buttons for each activity, displayed in a responsive grid layout
- **One-Tap Start**: Tap any activity button to instantly start tracking that activity
- **Single Active Activity**: Only one activity can be tracked at a time
- **Button Customization**: Each button has custom color, icon, and name
- **Built-in Activities**: Pre-configured buttons (Sleep, Work, Meal, Exercise, Commute, Break, Study, Entertainment)
- **Custom Activities**: Users can add unlimited custom activity buttons
- **Active State**: Currently tracking activity button shows animated border/glow effect
- **Quick Switch**: Tapping a different button automatically stops current (sets endTime) and starts new activity
- **Real-time Duration**: Active button displays elapsed time
- **Persistence**: Active timer persists across app restarts/crashes
- **Cross-Day Tracking**: Activities continue into next day without automatic stopping at midnight

### 2. Data Visualization
- **Daily Pie Chart**: Visual breakdown showing percentage of time spent on each activity
- **Current Time Indicator**: Red radius line showing where "now" is on the 24-hour chart (rotates continuously)
- **Empty State**: Blank chart when no activities tracked yet
- **Color Coding**: Distinct colors for different activity categories
- **Tap for Details**: Interactive segments showing exact duration when tapped
- **Legend**: Activity names with corresponding time durations
- **Unaccounted Time**: Tracks time when no activity was selected

### 3. Data Management
- **Daily View**: Default view showing current day's activities
- **History**: Browse previous days' tracked activities (deleted buttons retain historical data)
- **Edit Entries**: Modify or delete incorrectly logged activities
- **Manual Entry**: Add activities retroactively with custom time ranges
- **Button Reordering**: Drag and drop to rearrange button positions in grid
- **Soft Delete**: Deleted activity buttons hide from grid but preserve historical data

2. **Activity Button Grid**
   - Responsive grid layout (columns adapt to device width)
   - Unlimited rows, scrollable vertically
   - Each button shows:
     * Activity icon (emoji)

     * Custom background color
     * Duration overlay (if currently active)
   - Active button effects:
     * Pulsing border animation
     * Timer display overlay
     * Slightly elevated shadow

3. **Bottom Section**
   - Floating "Add Activity" button (+) for creating custom activities

     * Greyed out preset buttons not yet added
     * Small green "+" icon on upper right corner of each
     * Tap green "+" to instantly add to active grid
     * Includes unused default activities (Sleep, Work, Meal, etc.)

### Modals

1. **Add Activity Modal**
   - Name input field
   - Emoji picker (scrollable grid)
   - Color selector (preset colors)
   - Save/Cancel buttons
   - Opens from bottom (slide-up animation)

2. **Activity Options Modal** (Long press on button)
   - Triggered with haptic feedback (medium impact)
   - Function list:
     * Edit - Opens edit modal
     * Edit Layout - Enter reorder mode for drag & drop
     * Delete - Removes activity from grid (preserves historical data)

## Data Model

```typescript
interface Activity {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    buttonId: string; // reference to ActivityButton
    startTime: Date;
    endTime?: Date;
    duration?: number; // in milliseconds
    notes?: string;
    color: string; // hex color from button
}

interface ActivityButton {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    color: string; // hex color
    icon?: string; // emoji or icon name
    isDefault: boolean;
    position: number; // position in grid
    isVisible: boolean; // user can hide default buttons
}

interface DaySummary {
    date: Date;
    activities: Activity[];
    totalTrackedTime: number; // milliseconds
    unaccountedTime: number; // milliseconds (time when no activity selected)
}
```

## MVP Features (Phase 1)

## Design Considerations

### Button Design
- **Native iOS Appearance**:
  * Rounded corners (radius: 12-16px)
  * Subtle shadows for depth
  * iOS haptic feedback on press
  * Scale animation on touch (0.95 scale)
- **Button States**:
  * Default: Solid color background, white text/icon
  * Pressed: Slightly darker shade, scale down with haptic (light)
  * Long Press: Haptic (medium) + options modal
  * Active: Pulsing glow, timer overlay, border animation
  * Disabled: 50% opacity
- **Grid Layout**:
  * Responsive spacing
  * Minimum button size: 80x80px
  * Maximum: Fills available width/4 columns

### Default Activity Buttons
1. **Sleep** üò¥ - Deep blue (#2C3E50)
2. **Work** üíº - Purple (#8E44AD)
3. **Meal** üçΩÔ∏è - Orange (#E67E22)
4. **Exercise** üèÉ - Green (#27AE60)
5. **Commute** üöó - Gray (#7F8C8D)

7. **Break** ‚òï - Brown (#8B4513)
8. **Entertainment** üéÆ - Pink (#E91E63)

### UX Principles
- **Simplicity First**: Single tap to start/stop tracking
- **Visual Feedback**: Immediate response to user actions
- **Glanceable**: Current activity visible at a glance
- **Consistency**: All buttons follow same interaction pattern
- **Accessibility**: High contrast colors, clear labels

## Success Metrics
- Daily active usage rate
- Average number of activities tracked per day
- User retention after 7/30 days
- Time to start tracking (should be < 3 seconds)
- Chart interaction rate
